					<p>Hi. My name is Mike Constanza, and you are on my portfolio page. Right now it's just a work-in-progress, but hopefully soon it will be prettier and full of projects.</p><br>
					<p>Right now I work as a teacher. In the future, however, I hope to work on apps with an educational focus. Think: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com">Quizlet</a>, or <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I've used many different educational platforms, and found them lacking the features and usability a classroom requires. They clearly haven't been designed with teachers in mind. I would like to use my experience in that realm, along with my current (and future) skills as a developer to make better platforms for educators, including myself. </p> <br>
					<p>I'd love to hear from you if you have similar goals.</p>
